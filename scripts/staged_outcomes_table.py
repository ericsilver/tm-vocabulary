"""One table: every outcome in the trademark funnel, conditioned on its prerequisite.

The paper reports its outcomes in separate places on separate samples, which
makes it hard to see the thing that actually matters -- that the two axes of
vocabulary position do different work at different stages, and that the stage
where each one bites is informative. This script runs the SAME specification on
every outcome, each conditioned on having reached the prior stage, so the
coefficients are read down a single column.

Unit of observation is the DEBUT OWNER (the owner's first-ever filing), scored
on that filing, so one firm contributes one row and the funnel is a funnel.

Specification, identical at every stage:
    outcome ~ z_level + z_lean + log_len,  class x debut-year fixed effects,
    heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors
where
    z_level = standardized A = (KL vs past + KL vs future)/2  ("atypicality")
    z_lean  = standardized dKL = KL(vs past) - KL(vs future)  ("lead")
Coefficients are in percentage points of the outcome.

Stages:
    1. registered    | filed            -- did the debut filing complete registration
    2. passed_gate   | registered       -- did it survive the first use-proof gate
    3. funded        | filed            -- did the owner ever file a Reg D notice
    4. funded        | registered       -- same, among owners who registered
    5. listed        | funded           -- did a funded owner reach the listed universe
    6. listed        | registered       -- the paper's published unconditional comparison

The gate is the first maintenance filing, which is Section 8 for domestic
registrations and Section 71 for Madrid Section 66(a) extensions of protection;
both cancellation codes are read (see gate_outcome).

Stage windows differ and are reported per row: the gate needs elapsed
time, and Form D is only electronic from 2009, so no single cohort supports
every stage. That is a property of the institutions, not a defect of the design,
but it means rows are not a strict nested decomposition and the table says so.

Estimated at the production T = 50 themes (STAGED_T=200 reproduces the
earlier T = 200 version, archived as staged_outcomes*_T200.*).
